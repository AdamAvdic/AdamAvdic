ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Adam Avdic!

I'm in my final year pursuing a BSc in Computing Science at Simon Fraser University. Iâ€™m passionate about web development, game development, and software development, and I enjoy creating innovative, user-friendly solutions across these domains. I love experimenting with new technologies, crafting engaging digital experiences, and contributing to open-source projects.

Iâ€™m currently diving into areas like machine learning, data management, and interactive web-based applications. Always excited to collaborate on interesting projects!

Feel free to explore my repositories or get in touch. Letâ€™s build something awesome together!
